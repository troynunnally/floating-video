### Introduction

One day, as I was browsing  Facebook. I notice a subtle but unique feature. When you play a video and scroll down the page, the video sticks and floats to the corner of the page and continues to play.

Wait, Robert Smith paid student debt of entire debt of entire graduating class. Must be nice. Must be nice.

And Facebook is not the only one that does it, many others like Entertainment Weekly, CNN, and YouTube do it as well.

The typical user shrug it off as nothing more than a cool user experience update. But I believe has more powerful impact. If a software can allow a user to view a playing video while browsing the page, the video may keep the user engaged. If the user stays engaged, it may increase watch time. And if we increase watch time, that increases ratings on YouTube.

So my tip is this: If you have a website with a lot of video content like Techtwins.co, or a video blog website, or educational website with videos; consider adding the sticky floating video to enhance your user experience and boost your ratings on YouTube.

To help you execute it, we have rebuilt the sticky floating video and we are giving an example codebase for free so that you can implement in your own web app or site. If you do not have a tech guy on your team to implement. No worries. We have a team of developers ready to help you.
